## Lore: The Declining State of Bohemia's Economy

For Henry, the road to survival grows harsher with each passing day. What initially seemed like a manageable life of trading and earning groschen has shifted into a brutal struggle, as merchants offer paltry sums for his goods while demanding exorbitant prices for essentials. The bustling markets once full of opportunity now reflect a kingdom in collapse, where resources are scarce and every transaction feels unfair. This economic hardship stems from a kingdom ravaged by war and political unrest. Bohemiaâ€™s trade routes are disrupted, fields are abandoned, and taxes rise to fund endless battles, leaving merchants and craftsmen desperate to make ends meet. As Henry progresses, the toll of a broken world becomes all too real, forcing him to adapt and fight not just for victory, but for survival in an unforgiving economy.
