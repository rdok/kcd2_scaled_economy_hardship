## Important Update

As of March 14, 2025, if you use a `mod_order.txt` file (found in your game’s Mods folder, typically `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance2\Mods`), you’ll need to take one of these steps to ensure this mod works:
- Delete the `mod_order.txt` file, or
- Add the mod ID (`scaled_economy_hardship`) to your `mod_order.txt` file.

Most users won’t need to do anything, as they don’t use a `mod_order.txt` file.
