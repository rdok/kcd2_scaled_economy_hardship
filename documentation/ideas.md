# Mod Ideas

### Harder Beds

Disable long-term bed rentals in inns and steeply increase short-term rest prices, scaling with player progression. This keeps resting a strategic choice throughout the game. A similar mod exists for KCD 1 (e.g., [Expensive Inns](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/871)), which could accelerate development.

### Scaling Schnapps

Tie Saviour Schnapps usage to player level, requiring an additional schnapp per save for every few levels gained (e.g., 1 at level 1-5, 2 at 6-10, etc.), while raising prices progressively and cutting availability from most merchants. This ensures saving remains a challenge as wealth and gear improve.
