Tightens the game’s economy progressively as the player's level increases, making groschen harder to come by over time. Earnings and prices are adjusted to increase financial difficulty, with reductions in selling prices and increases in buying prices based on the player’s main level. This approach ensures a balanced early game while steadily ramping up the challenge.

[size=5]Lore: The Declining State of Bohemia's Economy[/size]

For Henry, the road to survival grows harsher with each passing day. What initially seemed like a manageable life of trading and earning groschen has shifted into a brutal struggle, as merchants offer paltry sums for his goods while demanding exorbitant prices for essentials. The bustling markets once full of opportunity now reflect a kingdom in collapse, where resources are scarce and every transaction feels unfair. This economic hardship stems from a kingdom ravaged by war and political unrest. Bohemia’s trade routes are disrupted, fields are abandoned, and taxes rise to fund endless battles, leaving merchants and craftsmen desperate to make ends meet. As Henry progresses, the toll of a broken world becomes all too real, forcing him to adapt and fight not just for victory, but for survival in an unforgiving economy.
